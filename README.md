# ⭐ Welcome to Orne

Orne.io is reshaping forest investment for the 21st century by leveraging blockchain to finance sustainable forestry.

## 🌱 What is Orne?

**Orne.io** empowers individuals and organizations to invest in **real trees** through the purchase of tokenized assets. These digital tokens, called **NFTrees**, represent **individual trees** managed within a real and sustainable forest. Each NFTree gives its holder a **right to the full revenue from the final timber harvest**, while remaining tradable at any point before maturity.

## 🚨 The Problem

Investing in forests has long been:

- Complex, requiring knowledge of forest management  
- Inaccessible, with high entry costs and illiquid assets  
- Slow, since trees take decades to mature

Meanwhile, global demand for timber is skyrocketing, and deforestation is accelerating—leading to rising wood prices and ecological risks.

## 🌍 The Orne Solution

Orne introduces a **tokenized model of tree ownership** that allows anyone to:

- **Own real trees** through NFTs with traceable on-chain data (species, age, geolocation, status)
- **Trade or hold trees** depending on market dynamics
- **Earn revenue** when trees are harvested
- **Support sustainable forestry**

We handle all planting, monitoring, and harvesting operations—so you don’t have to.
