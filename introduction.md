# ⭐ Welcome to Orne

**Orne.io** is transforming forest investment by making it simple, liquid, and accessible through blockchain technology.

## 🌱 A new way to invest in real forests

Traditionally, investing in forestry required time, expertise, and substantial capital. It was a slow, opaque market limited to a handful of insiders. Orne changes that.

We allow anyone to purchase a **digital share of a real tree**, sustainably managed in an operational forest. Each share entitles the holder to a **direct payout when the tree is harvested**, with no management required.

---

## 🚨 The problem

- Global demand for timber is skyrocketing (construction, energy, paper…)
- Wood is becoming a **strategic commodity**, but remains highly illiquid
- Forestry investment is locked behind paperwork, delays, and high entry barriers

## 🌍 Orne's solution

Through tokenization, Orne enables:

- **Easy and direct access to forest assets**
- **Valuation of trees throughout their lifecycle**
- **A bridge between sustainable forestry and decentralized finance**

Trees are sustainably managed, closely monitored, and revenues are shared with investors **automatically, transparently, and without intermediaries**.

## 🔁 From forest to wallet

Users can **exchange crypto for tree shares** (via $ORNE), track their holdings over time, and receive timber revenues directly into their wallet.

Orne acts as a **bridge between the physical forest and digital finance**, making natural resource investment efficient, transparent, and open to all.
