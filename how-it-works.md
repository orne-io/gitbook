# 🔍 How It Works

## 1. Acquire Tree Shares  
Use $ORNE to purchase a **share of a real tree** managed in a sustainable forest. Each share gives you rights to future timber revenue.

## 2. Track Your Forest Portfolio  
From your personal dashboard, monitor the age, species, location, and estimated value of your trees as they grow.

## 3. Hold or Exit  
Hold your shares long-term or trade them on our upcoming marketplace, depending on your investment strategy and market conditions.

## 4. Harvest & Earn  
Once the tree reaches maturity and is harvested, **100% of the revenue from the timber sale** is distributed to shareowners proportionally.

## ✅ Fully Managed by Orne  
We handle all forestry operations — planting, maintenance, thinning, and cutting. No administrative burden, no middlemen, just clean investment.
