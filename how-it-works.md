# üîç How It Works

## 1. Buy NFTrees  
Use crypto or $ORNE to acquire tokenized trees. Each NFT represents a real tree in a sustainable forest.

## 2. Track and Hold  
Your trees grow over time. Follow their evolution, value, and market price through your dashboard.

## 3. Trade or Wait  
Sell your NFTrees at any time via the marketplace or wait until maturity to receive timber revenue.

## 4. Harvest & Get Paid  
When your tree is cut down (at maturity), **100% of the timber proceeds** are transferred to your wallet.

## ‚úÖ Zero hassle  
We take care of planting, monitoring, forestry operations, and logistics. You just collect the value.
